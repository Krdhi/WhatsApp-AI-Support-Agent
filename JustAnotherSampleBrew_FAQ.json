It is brewed with ingredients that have Gluten in, but the enzymes used in production break it down to below the required standards.This is why gluten is listed on the back of cans. Every batch is tested, as obviously we want to get this right. People who are Celiac will have varying levels of intolerance, so it is up to them on a case-to-case basis."
